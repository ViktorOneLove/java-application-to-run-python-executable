  Create a Java or Kotlin console application that does the following:
  * Prompts the user to enter the path to the Python executable (to the Python interpreter)
  * Starts a new Python process that executes the following command: <code/>\<Path to Python\> -m timeit -r 10</code>, where <code/>\<Path to Python\></code> is the string entered by the user
  * Waiting for the command execution result
  * While waiting, every second the console displays how many seconds have passed since the start
  * After the end of the Python process, its result is also displayed in the console
